								<p>Welcome to Shark and Ray Conservation Centre! We’re proud to be Canada’s first research-centric shark NGO and are excited for you to check out all the amazing projects we have on the go. Scroll through our pages and get to know the team, learn about our mission and our exciting initiatives overseas and right here in our own backyard.</p>
								
								<p>Shark and Ray Conservation Centre, or ShARCC, was initiated at the end of 2016 and since then we have been establishing research projects in both the eastern and western Atlantic, largely looking at fisheries and population assessments for a multitude of elasmobranch (sharks, skates and rays) species. Since initiation we have been working hard to maintain a social media presence to remain transparent in our research and allow the public to keep up-to-date on our work</p>

								<p>As a research-centric NGO Sharks of the Atlantic Research and Conservation Centre (ShARCC) conducts research and projects that foster science-based conservation of elasmobranchs (sharks, rays and skates). Our holy grail at ShARCC is to prevent species extinction and restore populations to healthy levels. To achieve this we are working in close collaboration with academia, industry, governmental and non-governmental organizations, paired with educational and outreach projects. </p>
								<p>Currently ShARCC focuses on research, conservation and educational projects that aid in: </p>
								<ol>
								<li>Localizing important habitat areas and hotspots</li>
								<li>Localizing candidate areas for marine reserves or shark sanctuaries in the Atlantic</li>
								<li>Developing new research methods </li>
								<li>Making population assessments available for more elasmobranch species</li>
								<li>Providing independent scientific advice and evaluation of stock status, restoration, assessments, quotas and population trends</li>
								<li>Providing advice on sustainable science-based catch limits and fisheries</li>
								<li>Improving the scientific knowledge of the biology, ecology, conservation and management opportunities of elasmobranchs</li>
								<li>Educating and training of students, locals and communities</li>
								<li>Halting overfishing and illegal fishing</li>
								<li>Maintaining healthy, functional ecosystems</li>
							</ol>
								</p>
								<p> ShARCC strives to promote and utilize <i>only</i> non-lethal catch and research methods along with being as minimally invasive as possible. ShARCC may conduct research and conservation projects on species other than elasmobranchs in alliance with aim 10 (Maintaining healthy, functional ecosystems).</p>

								<p><h3><strong> Kirsti Burnett </strong></h3></p>
								<p> <b>Research Associate and Media Outreach Coordinator</b></p>
								<p>Kirsti grew up near the ocean on the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia. With passions consistently driving her toward all things ocean-related, particularly shark-related, she followed her dream in pursing a degree in Marine Biology at Dalhousie University, and then went on to achieve a Divemaster certification in St. Maarten where she worked on and in the water teaching others about shark conservation. </p>
								<p>Self-funding her way to South Africa and being accepted as an assistant researcher during an expedition to West Africa has given Kirsti shark-tagging and data-collection experience in the field, along with the practicality needed when working in foreign countries. Kirsti’s obtained skills paired with her enthusiasm and well-rounded experience in both field work and public outreach makes her the perfect member to direct social outreach and media initiatives, as well as assisting with research opportunities. She has also been a co-instructor of the Dalhousie University Elasmobranch Conservation Class since 2020.</p>
								<p> <i> "Understanding is the key to change. But before understanding comes curiosity of a question left unanswered, and the ocean, particularly sharks, hold many of these unanswered questions. We must answer these questions and fight for a greater understanding of these often-misunderstood animals if we are to bring about any kind of change.” </i> </p>
